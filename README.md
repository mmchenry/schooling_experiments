# wake_tracking

Code for running code through the wake-tracking project, which tests whether some fish species can follow the wake of neighboring fish in the dark.

The code is organized around the following steps in our workflow:

## Acquisition
This entails use of DLC to generate coordinates from videos. 

- **run_acquisition.py**: Uses kineKit to generate video from catalog parameters and make videos.  

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Processing)

[//]: # (Taking the raw coordinates from DLC videos, cleaning the data, and generating parameter metrics of the kinematics. Controlled with runProcessing.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Analysis)

[//]: # (Exploratory data analysis. )

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Presentation )

[//]: # (Stats and final figure construction.)
